## Translations
This library is only available in English and in French for now. If you make a translation please send a pull request. There are less than 10 strings to translate, it's an easy job! Strings to translate are in `strings.xml`, do not translate those in `donottranslate.xml`. And don't waste your time translating the demo app.
